### Acknowledgement

This project is a port of [logspot](https://logspot.vercel.app/), made by [Fayazara](https://github.com/fayazara) from
Vue with Nuxt, to React with Next 14 & the App Router, This is meant not only to provide a NextJS template but also a
good comparison of react to vue code for those looking to port from one, or trying to see what they'd prefer for their
first project.
